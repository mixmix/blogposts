# Quality-time work

There's a lot of normative pressure about work in our society.
I believe working less than 5 days a week is really healthy, and I'd love to make more visible the ways in which people are already doing this.
So here's the start of a collection of stories from people I know...

If you work less than 5 days a week, I'd love to add your story.

I'm interested in: 
- what path did you take to working less?
  - was it hard negotiating it?
  - what's the context of your work?
- why did you do it?
- are there any interesting implications for your work/ life?

what you do: land surveying

how did you get there:

I had been planning it for about 10 years.
I've always hated working fulltime. Earlier in life I spent a bunch of time on dole and I really liked that lifestyle.
The main thing I like is when it's a really sunny day, everyone is working, and I can avoid the crowds.

So I saved as much as I could and cut down on expenses.

The conversation with my work was quite hard. They said "we probably won't be able to give you 3 days a week, and quite frankly you'd be hard pressed to find employment anywhere else".
I said "well if need be I'll go back to making coffee".

I think this was a period where one of the bosses went away, so things were pretty full on.
They tend to hire graduates a lot.. I said I could do more than a graduate can do in 5 days in 3 days.

If you enjoy what you do, then you're actually going to be better at is 3 days a week instead of 5.

implications: I just means can't work on the really pressing urgents jobs
I'd been working for that employer 13 years.

I worked as a barrista till I was about 30, and really loved it, but I didn't know if I could do it forever. I went and saw the career services, and ended up reading up a lot about land surveying. I went into the company nearest me, and told them I wanted to be a land surveyor, and they gave me a job. I trained on the job.

I come back from 3 days of work, and I feel like I have some catching up to do with getting to know my son. I can't imagine I would ever be able to catch up if I worked 5 days.

I'm an editor but I work as a publisher (but I manage a 1 year programme). I'm basically a teacher.

I don't think I can remember why. Publishing is a really hard and demanding career, and I'd worked really hard. Oh yeah, I used to be a workaholic.
I got a new job and had a really full on year.
Then I realised I could make a change .. I guess my priorities changed.
But everyone in publishing keeps crazy hours... but running a programme I realised I was my own boss.

The first year I was on secondment. When they made me a job offer I said I wanted 4 days, they said ok.
The programme only has 1.6 people. Normally it's 1.0 + 0.6, I convinced them they could do 0.8 + 0.8 and it would save them money.

Is there anything to know about it ? 
It's awesome .. it took me about 6 months to get used to it - I felt naughty for ages.

I take thursdays off. I will never go back to fulltime. My life is exponentially better.
I conquered by workaholism.

This is a "later in life" story.

When my new-at-the-time partner and I moved to a rural area, partly to cut expenses, a friend/neighbor had a .net web developer gig for 40 hours a week.  She wanted to work less and I needed a job, so she proposed to her client that she and I share the contract.  The client accepted. (They trusted her and it brought more of a mix of skills to the client, as well as backup capability when one of us was sick or on vacation or they just needed more hours for a bit.)  So we job-shared and each worked 20 hours a week.  I highly recommend job sharing!

Then the client was having money troubles and made our shared job into 20 hours/week.  So we each worked 10.  

Since I was done raising children and we were living very cheaply, I could make ends meet on the 10 hours. To be clear, part of living very cheaply was being lucky enough to be able to be able to buy into our small fairly sustainable housing co-op from the sale of my house in the city and some retirement savings, with no remaining debt.  But part is also living in the co-op where we share a lot of expenses, which I also recommend, as long as you trust the people a lot.

I can just agree with others here on life implications: it was incredibly awesome!  Gave me a chance to contribute lots more time to the open source gift work my partner and I do.  Compared to the previous period of my life when I was working full time in the city, commuting, and raising a couple kids as a single mom, this was heaven. (Not that I didn't love raising kids, but still...)

The lower stress levels were amazing.  (The effects on health of stress levels are real, especially as we get older.)  Even though I was still working a fair number of hours all together, being more in control of my personal schedule was huge, and being able to mostly work on something I think is actually useful was a real mental boost.
