# Quality-time work

There's a lot of normative pressure about work in our society.
I believe working less than 5 days a week is really healthy, and I'd love to make more visible the ways in which people are already doing this.
So here's the start of a collection of stories from people I know...

If you work less than 5 days a week, I'd love to add your story.

I'm interested in: 
- what path did you take to working less?
  - was it hard negotiating it?
  - what's the context of your work?
- why did you do it?
- are there any interesting implications for your work/ life?

what you do: land surveying

how did you get there:

I had been planning it for about 10 years.
I've always hated working fulltime. Earlier in life I spent a bunch of time on dole and I really liked that lifestyle.
The main thing I like is when it's a really sunny day, everyone is working, and I can avoid the crowds.

So I saved as much as I could and cut down on expenses.

The conversation with my work was quite hard. They said "we probably won't be able to give you 3 days a week, and quite frankly you'd be hard pressed to find employment anywhere else".
I said "well if need be I'll go back to making coffee".

I think this was a period where one of the bosses went away, so things were pretty full on.
They tend to hire graduates a lot.. I said I could do more than a graduate can do in 5 days in 3 days.

If you enjoy what you do, then you're actually going to be better at is 3 days a week instead of 5.

implications: I just means can't work on the really pressing urgents jobs
I'd been working for that employer 13 years.

I worked as a barrista till I was about 30, and really loved it, but I didn't know if I could do it forever. I went and saw the career services, and ended up reading up a lot about land surveying. I went into the company nearest me, and told them I wanted to be a land surveyor, and they gave me a job. I trained on the job.

I come back from 3 days of work, and I feel like I have some catching up to do with getting to know my son. I can't imagine I would ever be able to catch up if I worked 5 days.

I'm an editor but I work as a publisher (but I manage a 1 year programme). I'm basically a teacher.

I don't think I can remember why. Publishing is a really hard and demanding career, and I'd worked really hard. Oh yeah, I used to be a workaholic.
I got a new job and had a really full on year.
Then I realised I could make a change .. I guess my priorities changed.
But everyone in publishing keeps crazy hours... but running a programme I realised I was my own boss.

The first year I was on secondment. When they made me a job offer I said I wanted 4 days, they said ok.
The programme only has 1.6 people. Normally it's 1.0 + 0.6, I convinced them they could do 0.8 + 0.8 and it would save them money.

Is there anything to know about it ? 
It's awesome .. it took me about 6 months to get used to it - I felt naughty for ages.

I take thursdays off. I will never go back to fulltime. My life is exponentially better.
I conquered by workaholism.

I'm a developer and designer living on a sailboat.

### what path did you take to working less?

I have looked into ways of needing less money to live, instead of looking for ways to making more.

### was it hard negotiating it?

I've always found the idea of living a minimalist and uncluttered life appealing. Getting rid of the right things has been a learning process, choosing the optimal handlful of things that I truly cherrished was something that I improved over time.

### what's the context of your work?

I make a living building video games and applications for mobile and desktops independently. 

### why did you do it?

I found my previous life to be unsustainable, and myself struggling to keeping up with the sacrifices required in order to balance income and living costs of the city-life. Especially in regard to my physical health.

### are there any interesting implications for your work/ life?

I have been working throughout our crossing of the South Pacific ocean. Doing internet related work whist living a nomadic life has been a challenge, but it has put me in situations where I had to build tools that aligned with my lifestyle, so leaner projects with less dependencies that worked more independently from libraries.
