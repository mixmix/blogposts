# Quality-time work

There's a lot of normative pressure about work in our society.
I believe working less than 5 days a week is really healthy, and I'd love to make more visible the ways in which people are already doing this.
So here's the start of a collection of stories from people I know...

If you work less than 5 days a week, I'd love to add your story.

I'm interested in: 
- what path did you take to working less?
  - was it hard negotiating it?
  - what's the context of your work?
- why did you do it?
- are there any interesting implications for your work/ life?

what you do: land surveying

how did you get there:

I had been planning it for about 10 years.
I've always hated working fulltime. Earlier in life I spent a bunch of time on dole and I really liked that lifestyle.
The main thing I like is when it's a really sunny day, everyone is working, and I can avoid the crowds.

So I saved as much as I could and cut down on expenses.

The conversation with my work was quite hard. They said "we probably won't be able to give you 3 days a week, and quite frankly you'd be hard pressed to find employment anywhere else".
I said "well if need be I'll go back to making coffee".

I think this was a period where one of the bosses went away, so things were pretty full on.
They tend to hire graduates a lot.. I said I could do more than a graduate can do in 5 days in 3 days.

If you enjoy what you do, then you're actually going to be better at is 3 days a week instead of 5.

implications: I just means can't work on the really pressing urgents jobs
I'd been working for that employer 13 years.

I worked as a barrista till I was about 30, and really loved it, but I didn't know if I could do it forever. I went and saw the career services, and ended up reading up a lot about land surveying. I went into the company nearest me, and told them I wanted to be a land surveyor, and they gave me a job. I trained on the job.

I come back from 3 days of work, and I feel like I have some catching up to do with getting to know my son. I can't imagine I would ever be able to catch up if I worked 5 days.

I'm an editor but I work as a publisher (but I manage a 1 year programme). I'm basically a teacher.

I don't think I can remember why. Publishing is a really hard and demanding career, and I'd worked really hard. Oh yeah, I used to be a workaholic.
I got a new job and had a really full on year.
Then I realised I could make a change .. I guess my priorities changed.
But everyone in publishing keeps crazy hours... but running a programme I realised I was my own boss.

The first year I was on secondment. When they made me a job offer I said I wanted 4 days, they said ok.
The programme only has 1.6 people. Normally it's 1.0 + 0.6, I convinced them they could do 0.8 + 0.8 and it would save them money.

Is there anything to know about it ? 
It's awesome .. it took me about 6 months to get used to it - I felt naughty for ages.

I take thursdays off. I will never go back to fulltime. My life is exponentially better.
I conquered by workaholism.

I was working for the Wynyard Group in 2013 as a test engineer. I had been working in software for around a year straight out of highschool. I started to contemplate that I could easily spend the majority of the rest of my life working nine to five in a job that didn't engage me. So I decided that I would move to Wellington, get a job as a software developer and work four days a week.

Six months later, I moved to Wellington, attended and graduated Dev Academy, and then shortly found a job as a developer at Powershop (now known as Flux Federation). In my interview process, I expressed my desire to work four days a week, and to my delight found out that there were already developers at Powershop working four days a week. I was told that I would start at five days a week, and when I was settled in we would reconsider.

Over the next year I broached the subject with my manager frequently in catchups, but encountered resistance. My manager wondered aloud why everyone else was happy to work forty hours a week, and yet I wanted to work thirty-two. So I settled in working five days a week. However, as my job became more comfortable and routine, my appetite for side-projects grew again. I found that while I had appetite, my energy levels at work suffered as I pushed myself working late nights.

Eventually this got to the point where it was clearly not working for myself or for the business. My manager and I had a frank discussion and concluded that the best thing for me was to work four days a week, so that I would have more time to dedicate to my side-projects without impacting my day job.

This was in late 2015, so around two years ago at the time of writing. Since then, I have changed jobs, and was able to use my four day a week arrangement in my previous workplace to negotiate the same arrangement in this role.

Overall I have found this to be a very positive experience. I have more time to relax and to work on my side-projects, as well as keeping up with life admin duties. I do have to spend a bit of energy ensuring that I overcommunicate so that work can continue in my absence. I find this is generally good practice anyway, as you really want to be able to continue work even if a teammate is sick or is called away to fight a fire.

Aside from the obvious financial impact of taking a 20% paycut, there are a few negative side-effects. While I do not have hard evidence for this, if your ambitions are about climbing the ladder in your organisation, working four days a week might not give the impression that you want. Additionally, it's easy to miss in-person communications and conversations that most everyone else was present for.

There is also an interesting phenomena where people assume that if you work four days a week, that you must be lazy. For some people, additional relaxation time might be the main reason they work less. That can be nice, but personally I work around six days a week, all I'm changing is the proportion of my professional work vs personal/charitabe.

This is a "later in life" story.

When my new-at-the-time partner and I moved to a rural area, partly to cut expenses, a friend/neighbor had a .net web developer gig for 40 hours a week.  She wanted to work less and I needed a job, so she proposed to her client that she and I share the contract.  The client accepted. (They trusted her and it brought more of a mix of skills to the client, as well as backup capability when one of us was sick or on vacation or they just needed more hours for a bit.)  So we job-shared and each worked 20 hours a week.  I highly recommend job sharing!

Then the client was having money troubles and made our shared job into 20 hours/week.  So we each worked 10.  

Since I was done raising children and we were living very cheaply, I could make ends meet on the 10 hours. To be clear, part of living very cheaply was being lucky enough to be able to be able to buy into our small fairly sustainable housing co-op from the sale of my house in the city and some retirement savings, with no remaining debt.  But part is also living in the co-op where we share a lot of expenses, which I also recommend, as long as you trust the people a lot.

I can just agree with others here on life implications: it was incredibly awesome!  Gave me a chance to contribute lots more time to the open source gift work my partner and I do.  Compared to the previous period of my life when I was working full time in the city, commuting, and raising a couple kids as a single mom, this was heaven. (Not that I didn't love raising kids, but still...)

The lower stress levels were amazing.  (The effects on health of stress levels are real, especially as we get older.)  Even though I was still working a fair number of hours all together, being more in control of my personal schedule was huge, and being able to mostly work on something I think is actually useful was a real mental boost.

### what path did you take to working less?

I have looked into ways of needing less money to live, instead of looking for ways to making more.

### was it hard negotiating it?

I've always found the idea of living a minimalist and uncluttered life appealing. Getting rid of the right things has been a learning process, choosing the optimal handlful of things that I truly cherrished was something that I improved over time.

### what's the context of your work?

I make a living building video games and applications for mobile and desktops independently. 

### why did you do it?

I found my previous life to be unsustainable, and myself struggling to keeping up with the sacrifices required in order to balance income and living costs of the city-life. Especially in regard to my physical health.

### are there any interesting implications for your work/ life?

I have been working throughout our crossing of the South Pacific ocean. Doing internet related work whist living a nomadic life has been a challenge, but it has put me in situations where I had to build tools that aligned with my lifestyle, so leaner projects with less dependencies that worked more independently from libraries.
