# Power & Learning

I estimate state education has set my technical ability as a coder back about a decade.
This is annoying. I now have my finger on a thread that I really think needs pulling.

I really value conciseness so here's what I think the essence of it is: 
> power dynamics hamper learning; what a waste of potential.

There's a chance I'm wrong, but I don't think so. Here's my story for you to parse for yourself.

---

As an inquisitive (and naive) teenager, I judged coding largely by what was offered at school. [add a sentence about what was offered at school]. It seemed like a boring and unchallenging topic. 

[Two sentences or short anecdote about you as a youth, always being the one asking questions, not understanding why you were expected to color in the lines, questing authority - not out of spite but because that's how you showed you really cared, how you held onto your genuine love of learning in a system trying to wring it out of you (echo Unlimited's mission later). Set the scene for your later subborness about the teaching job you were willing to take.]

So I set my mind to topics with more challenge, following in my father's footsteps to maths and sciences. I followed a fairly standard course, takinga BS in mathmatics. After a stint as a post-graduate research assistant (modelling blood splatter of blunt weapon trauma), I followed in my mother's footsteps and trained as a teacher. 

I'd really enjoyed tutoring at university, but found that education on education - teacher training - was mostly about acting and crowd control.

I practiced small transgressions in response to an oppressive system. I wore ripped jeans to 'meet the principles' day, and had to get a special note to teach, because apparently you can't graduate _in absentia_ without filling in a form. I just couldn't see myself teaching in a standard school.

I wasn't a true rebel, so much as picky, stuborn, and lucky enough to be able to afford it. I refused to take any teaching job, except one, at an anomoly of an institution called [Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery](http://aotawhiti.school.nz/), or to me just "Unlimited". 

Unlimited is a state funded public secondary school that exists because of a loophole in the law, which allowed the bending of a rule meant for the integration of church schools into a rule which allowed the school to write its own assessment rules. Its "special character" is "a fundamental tenet that the child is central in directing his or her own learning so that the enthusiasm and love of learning is retained." My kind of place.

I can talk a lot about what made that environment transformative, but I think the key was radically more equal power dynamics.

As a Learning Advisor there, I didn't assert authority through enforcing arbitrary rules. I had conversations on a first name-basis with people about what they cared about in life. Classes didn't have age-barriers, and students could choose what they wanted to do every 5 weeks. Instead of segregation and age-based hierarchy, there was conversation and experiementation.

It felt good. People were kind (not to be confused with nice), and we all learnt a lot.

Instead of negotiating bullying and claustrophobia, students spent their time doing things like attending university level classes, running New Zealand's only openDNS server from a bedroom, and working together to support a friend with depression. Some of the experiences moved me so deeply I still cry when I recall them.

It makes me thoroughly sad - and angry - thinking about how much average state education is missing the mark.

I loved teaching at Unlimited, but as a lifelong learner, I felt like I need to develop my own skills beyond teaching. Oh, and there was also a massive earthquake that destroyed the city. SoI moved away and went to art school, where I got into programming the laser cutter (which I was shocked to find almost no one else was using). 

I was the worst adult student ever. I know what good education looks like, and I really like giving feedback. I wasn't very satified with the education I was getting there.

Over summer break I got introduced to [Enspiral](http://www.enspiral.com), where Joshua Vial taught me (and several others) to be web developers in a sort of casual internship - a very early predecessor to the programming school we went on to create. 

So I left art school to help build [Loomio](http://www.loomio.org) (an open source collaborative decision-making tool), and continue learnign to code.

The people of Loomio - and of the garden of Enspiral in which it grew - were the next group of most excellent people I met. [sentence about how Enspiral is kind of like Unlimited - pointing to the deeper values/truth you were attracted to].

This is where I was introduced more excplicitly to a discourse around power.

---

Now, I'm now a teacher at [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://www.devacademy.co.nz), a coding bootcamp that trains non-techinical people to become junior web developers in 9 weeks. It's a synthesis of my interests to date - programming, learning, and good people [is it really good people? isn't it something like... people who want to really collaborate? or community building? there are good people everywhere, but your interest is in something a bit more specific].

I take myself, and those around me, beyond the limits of technical ability. The only way you can do that effectively, and get anything out of it, is to be super up-front about what you do and don't understand.

Not knowing things for some reason brings up shame for people. The most dangerous thing for a student is self-doubt, and sitting on shame is a good way to get that. There's a whole area of study around this topic in regard to students.

I'm more interested in how _not knowing_ plays out for teachers. I believe this is the reason I'm not currently an ascendant cyber-wizard.

When you don't know a thing as a teacher, a **very interesting** decision path emerges: 

A) lie, or undermine the question

B) say you don't know


## Why would you lie?

Well, if your position as teacher is predicated on your knowing more, being the _source of truth_ , then not knowing might seem to contradict that.

Why would anyone think a person could know everything? Ummm, why else should they be able to tell me what to do? 

The average high-school teacher is in a surprisingly precarious power-position. It might look like they have control, but it works only through carefully guided consent of the class. [one more sentence about how this works in practice]

For a teacher in a position where their authority is coupled to their knowledge, it is awefuly appealing to never take the conversation near topics which might erode that position.

I think this is why classes on computers suck so bad in highschool - they are born of institution that binds teaching to the bounds of individual mastery, which is finite. Education around computers offers a unique window into the future of learning: the field is moving so fast that **the only reasonable path is to say "I don't know"** a lot. 

To get reasonable education we need to fix this situation where teachers can't say "I don't know" without upsetting the power dynamic from which they derive their authority. 

[paragraph about how it's not that teachers are evil power-mongers - right now they need that authority to stay safe in front of students, because the education system does now allow them the normal humanising tools of social safety, such as building genuine relationships, and showing vulnerability - but this does everyone trapped in that dynamic a huge disservice. students don't learn, good teachers burn out, and as a society we don't teach people the super critical skills of listening, empathy, collaboration, self-determination and motivation].

Being able to say "I don't know" is the beginning of some fantastic cascading effects: 
- you can continue "...but how would we find out?!" challening students not to focus just on the content, but the process.
- It's an opportunity to model good learning - outside school you have to know how to find out for yourself when you aren't given the answer.
- everyone learning together - teacher included! If teachers are going to stay current and awake, this is a must.
- it removes as an option the "authority through knowledge" engine [why is this good?]
- conversation predisposed towards being more equal [what does this enable?]
- brings a humanistic dynamic back to education: less lying, better conversations
- removes shame and makes it OK to not know. This is the heart of the "growth mindset" that's so fashionable to talk about these days.
- you can get beyond the boring safe topics, and leave open the possibility for inspiration and excitement about topics students may fall in love with (like me and programming, 15 years too late)
  - unlocks play. human beings are natural joyful learners. this is the previous resource our current system tragically squashes.

[closing paragraph bringing it all together. need to come back to "power dynamics hamper learning; what a waste of potential" - now pain a picture of a different reality where this is not the case. what's your call to action to get us there?]
