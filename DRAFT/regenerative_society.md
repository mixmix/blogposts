My friends and I are interested in living in a different world. Some of us want to not suffer and die in climate change, some to see stateless democracy succeed the nation state.
I would like us to [join the galactic council](http://hyper.mixmix.io/mixmix/blogposts/blob/master/uncapturable_distribution.md).
There are many common threads to our different visions and the paths we think we need to take to get there - things like more equality, reformation of economies, alternative modes of organising with large groups.

Something all these have in common is bringing about change in what already exists. Knowing how to effect change well is a VERY HARD problem - it's involves balancing things like a need for scale with preservation of values, or balancing inclusivity with alacrity.
When you're changing an economy, or how your company makes decisions, or societal behaviour, it's complex because of the number of variables and their inter-relatedness.

I think a useful way to think about it is with a [**systems theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) perspective.
In short, while we have discrete labels and titles for objects, entities, or institutions, these are just constructions of convenience and what you're actually looking at is a very large system of interweaving patterns with fuzzy boundaries.
Taken to it's extreme, this might imply there is no 'me', rather just a very complex unity. This is pretty and kind of grounding, but not a very actionable model.
I'd like to resolve this by extending systems theory back a little toward discreteness by adding the concept of a **pattern**.
Let's say a pattern is a commonly occuring or stable 'area' of system.

**Examples of pattern**

- **human** - a 'human' is (locally) a commonly occuring pattern. Look at the person nearest you and squint your eyes, that's more like a human.
You're seeing a persistant weaving of atoms and behaviour. With a systems lens, it's hard to see where the boundary of a human is, as the human's pattern is afforded by a symphony of smaller and larger patterns.
From more easier to conceive patterns like 'human-tpye' DNA, 'bacterial-type' DNA, and physiological state, to more intangible patterns like hunger, insurance, friendship, economy, and nation.
Considering how taking any of these away might destroy or fundamentally deform this human pattern, you can start to appreciate the fuziness of the boundary of a human.

- **friendship** - a pattern of interaction between two human-type patterns.

- **book** - a pattern of characters found on paper or digitally. Created, arranged, prioritised, and persisted by human-type patterns. Changes individual humans, and human interaction patterns.

- **el nino** - a recurring weather pattern. It's very large, hard to predict, influences a lot of human-related patterns.

- **Venture Capital** - a pattern of large-scale money movement. Stabilised by a dominant credit pattern, contract-type patterns, and inequality-type patterns (?).

- **physical abuse** - a pattern of interaction between human patterns.

Changes human patterns, and increases likihood of those patterns involved to create future abuse patterns (or anti-patterns).
Stabilized by inequality patterns.

__It's tempting to make a destinction between classes of pattern, for example object-type pattern versus interaction-type pattern.
I'd like to defer making a decision about whether that serves as a lens (I uspect this is how we already think of the world and might be narrowing our thinking).__

How does this help us change the world?
The way we model the world influences our approach to changing it. If our model is sloppy, out action is going to be ineffective.
It's tempting to fall back to simpler more discretised models because they're easier to work with.
Look for common shortcuts like dropping variables, discretisation, and narrativisation.

Some failings these breed are things like:
  - western doctors treating physical symptoms with just drugs (ignoring emotional and social patterns)
  - treating homelessness as an individual's problem
  - social inequity being blamed on 'the 1%'
  - surprise stock-market crashes


So if the world is a system of patterns, how do you change existing patterns or build new ones?

## What is the nature of a pattern?

---

What is a pattern? It's a persistent chunk or aspect of a system.

Patterns that persist have commonalities:
- aspects which stabilise the pattern
- aspects which change the pattern

Examples:

- human :




Patterns which persist usually have a way to stabilise themselves, and a way to adapt.
Considering what interupts or destabilises a pattern


I think persistence is afforded by some common aspects (patterns within a pattern):

- (A) stabilising aspects (within, without)
- (B) modifying aspects (within, without)
- (C) sensing aspects (?!)

other symptoms:
- persists
- stablie parts


- C) sources that define fitness/ success (or provide selection pressure)
       __<< this may just be another type of stability? >>_

examples :
- **human genome**
  - A:
    - within : molecular bonding, enzymatic replication
    - without : chemically stable cell, body which positions the DNA more favourably for replication
  - B: sex (random recombination of parent DNA), low rate of point mutation
  - C: world interacting with body the DNA builds leading to natural selection of some versions of genome over generations (somewhat simplified)

- **Democracy**
  - A: Law + enforcement, serving citizen patterns by offering protection & infrastructure, promise of participation in pattern modification, international agreements
  - B: government, elections, lobbying
  - C: corporations, other nations, citizens, democratic theory

- **Communism**
  - A: Militarily enforced compliance to rules, promise of equality, promise of serving citizens
  - B: government ... (I don't know how communist states evolve)
  - C: other nations, party memebers, citizens

- **Google**
  - A: Legal structure (relationship with a nation), monopoly on niche money-making position (internet advertising), building a free to use platform that embeds feeding niche, making it hard for competion, and hard for users to leave.
  - B: 20% time, aquiring companies with new tech, expanding into new markets (android), ..
  - C: apple, facebook, users, other companies

These are fairly shallow analyses, but hopefully they reveal some of the sorts of dependancy that patterns have. In particular it's interesting to consider the patterns a pattern is build from (for example companies and citizens with a democratic nation) and the patterns that a pattern interacts with (for example a country interacting with out countries, the environment, and trans-national organisations). \

I suspect these are worth considering because how patterns interact withing a system over the long term can help us predict how likely a pattern is to persist.

The USSR as a communist state has not persisted because they didn't establish within their pattern the right balance of stability within their system and between their system and others.
French revolution - not enough stability with citizens

When the pattern involves humans :

## Complex patterns

Patterns in the wild tend to be *complex*.

Humanity prefers (and has excelled at) dealing with *complicated* patterns.
We've mastered building *complicated* things (like computers, cars). These are patterns that tend to be made up of super-stable patterns ('parts', 'components', with a limited amount of interdependence, making them easier to design and debug.

> **Complicated patterns have more stable parts, and lend themselves to mapping.**

*Complex* patterns are made up of patterns that are more likely to change or adapt, and are highly interdependent, making them very hard to predict and design.

Swapping a computer fan is very different than swapping a human heart.
Writing an app is very different than predicting whether it will be a success in the app-store.
The difference in how you approach interacting with a pattern depends on whether it's complicated or complex.

Nation states, inequality and climate-change are complex patterns.

Fortunately there are a number of methodologies that are effective as interaction patterns for humans interacting with complex patterns.
Close to my experience are :
  - [Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)
  - [Theory U](https://www.presencing.com/theoryu)
  - [Social Labs](http://www.social-labs.com/)

> **Complex patterns are dynamic, and require dynamic way-finding (maps)**

These patterns of interaction all have the following in common:
  - forget your assumptions you think are 'true' about the complex system
  - go to the information-rich areas of the pattern
  - communicate, and listen
  - syntesise together
  - iterate

(These are some really powerful patterns and that is quite an injustice of a description. Please read more on them or talk with me about these. I'm also in love with [Empathy Interviews](https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/interview-for-empathy.pdf) at the moment.)

These methodologies are so effective because they hold a frame for **growing new complex patterns**

I'd like to suggest the best way to interact with complex systems in general is to grow patterns.

Interestingly these methodologies are actually an example of a persistant complex pattern.
